![Logo](./images/xyplorer.png) [XYplorer](https://www.xyplorer.com/) is an amazing explorer for Windows.  Something like "Windows Explorer" but no, the comparison can't be done in fact (we can’t compare a commodore 64 with a recent computer).

[XYplorer](https://www.xyplorer.com/) is a tool that let you to work very efficiently.

One of my favorite function is the “Branch view” (“liste applatie” in French), allowing you to view every files just like if there were in one folder.

## Scripts

<!-- below, content of ./020-scripts/ArchiveSelectedFiles/readme.md -->

### ArchiveSelectedFiles

Add a custom button that will allow you to create an archive of the selected files/folder.

You can select one or more folder and the script will create one ZIP by selected folder as you can see in the illustration below

### xyPlorer - Tips & Tricks - Batch Rename Files

#### Replace one value with another ##

xyPlorer allows you to rename hundreds of files on the fly in the simplest way.

Imagine that you have files with a clearly identifiable `pattern` in the filename, e.g. a : *you want to replace the number 310 in the filename with 789*

So you have files with these names:

* `C:\data\RTD310A-001-001A.txt`
* `C:\data\RTD310A-001-001B.txt`
* `C:\data\RTD310A-001-001C.txt`
* `C:\data\RTD310A-001-001D.txt`
* `C:\data\RTD310A-001-001E.txt`

and you want

* `C:\data\RTD789A-001-001A.txt`
* `C:\data\RTD789A-001-001B.txt`
* `C:\data\RTD789A-001-001C.txt`
* `C:\data\RTD789A-001-001D.txt`
* `C:\data\RTD789A-001-001E.txt`

With xyPlorer, this is done in a single operation:

1. Go to the folder that contains the files you want to rename
2. Click on the `File` menu
3. Select `Special Renaming`.
4. Choose `Search and Replace`.
5. In the window that appears, at the bottom left, you have a small "i" of information to get help. You will learn that the syntax is `old/new`, so just type "310/789". (search for pattern 310 and replace with 789).
6. Click on the `View` button to see what it looks like and just `validate` the old renaming action.

#### Take out a prefix

![](./030-batch/rename/images/xyplorer_rename_batch.png)

Expression: `^cck_ >`

FIND
`^` = start of file name
`cck_` = pattern to find (here, prefix to remove)

REPLACE
= All of the following > is what should be replaced.   When `cck_` is found, it is replaced by `...`
by putting nothing, so we say that the prefix should be removed.

Running `^cck_ >` removes the prefix from the selected files.
